# ‚ôø Autonomous Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arm (AWRA)

An intelligent assistive system designed to empower individuals with mobility impairments and the elderly.  
It integrates **autonomous navigation**, **voice-controlled interaction**, and a **multi-axis robotic arm** to help users move and perform daily tasks independently.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Enable **autonomous movement** of a wheelchair in indoor environments.  
- Provide **robotic assistance** for simple daily tasks like grabbing, lifting, or reaching objects.  
- Enhance **user independence** and reduce reliance on external caregivers.  
- Ensure **safe, smooth navigation** with obstacle detection and path planning.  
- Build a foundation for **future smart healthcare applications**.

---

## üß© System Overview
The project combines mechanical, electrical, and software subsystems into one integrated platform:
- **Mechanical Design:** Lightweight, stable wheelchair chassis with a mounted robotic arm.
- **Embedded Control:** Microcontrollers manage sensor data and motor actuation.
- **Software Intelligence:** ROS2 for communication, navigation, and motion planning.
- **User Interface:** Voice command recognition for intuitive operation.

---

## üß† Methodology
1. **Research & Analysis:** Understanding user needs and defining system requirements.  
2. **Mechanical Design:** Modeling wheelchair and robotic arm in SolidWorks; verifying loads and motion range.  
3. **Control & Programming:** Implementing motion control, navigation, and voice recognition logic.  
4. **Integration & Testing:** Combining all modules, simulation in Gazebo, and real-world validation.
