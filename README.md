# ♿ Autonomous Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arm (AWRA)

An intelligent assistive system designed to empower individuals with mobility impairments and the elderly.  
It integrates **autonomous navigation**, **voice-controlled interaction**, and a **multi-axis robotic arm** to help users move and perform daily tasks independently.  
This project is a **Graduation Project for the Mechatronics Department, Faculty of Engineering – Sphinx University (2025/2026)**.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Enable **autonomous movement** of a wheelchair in indoor environments.  
- Provide **robotic assistance** for simple daily tasks like grabbing, lifting, or reaching objects.  
- Enhance **user independence** and reduce reliance on external caregivers.  
- Ensure **safe, smooth navigation** with obstacle detection and path planning.  
- Build a foundation for **future smart healthcare applications**.
