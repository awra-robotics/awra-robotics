  <h1>Autonomous Wheelchair-Mounted Robotic Arm for People with Mobility Impairments</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The project aims to develop an autonomous wheelchair integrated with a robotic arm designed to assist individuals with mobility impairments and elderly users. The system combines smart navigation, voice command control, and object interaction to enhance user independence and improve their quality of life. By enabling self-directed movement and simple task execution, the project reduces dependency on caregivers and promotes a safer, more comfortable daily experience.
  </p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enhance the independence of people with mobility limitations through a self-driving wheelchair system.</li>
    <li>Integrate a robotic arm capable of assisting users with basic daily activities such as grasping, reaching, or interacting with objects.</li>
    <li>Provide intuitive and accessible control using voice commands for ease of use.</li>
    <li>Ensure safe navigation in indoor environments through obstacle detection and avoidance.</li>
    <li>Promote user comfort, safety, and confidence in performing routine tasks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>
    The project is structured into several key stages, beginning with a comprehensive study of user needs and technical requirements. The design phase involves creating a suitable mechanical structure for both the wheelchair and robotic arm, ensuring stability, functionality, and ergonomic considerations. Following the design, control systems are developed to manage motion, navigation, and task execution with precision and reliability. The system will also incorporate software modules for intelligent decision-making and responsive interaction with the environment.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Vision</h2>
  <p>
    This project serves as a foundation for developing advanced assistive technologies that empower individuals with disabilities. Future versions could expand to include smart healthcare applications, remote monitoring, and enhanced AI-based interaction systems to further improve autonomy and accessibility.
